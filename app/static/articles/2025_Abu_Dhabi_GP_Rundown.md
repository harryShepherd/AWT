## A Season Finale to Remember

---

The season-finale race at the scenic Yas Marina Circuit lit up under floodlights, delivering high stakes, strong showings and ultimate glory for one driver.  

## Championship on the Line — Qualifying & Build-up

As the final weekend approached, the stakes were clear: the 2025 championship would be decided here in Abu Dhabi. Qualifying saw Max Verstappen clinch pole position — a strong statement of intent for the race showdown.

Behind him, the championship contenders were locked in — with all eyes on how strategy, nerve, and execution would decide the title.  

## The Grand Prix — Victory, Pressure & Championship Drama

As lights-out came and 58 laps of racing unfolded, Verstappen delivered when it mattered, converting pole into a commanding race win.

In second place, Oscar Piastri (McLaren) crossed the line — a solid finish, but not enough to deny the title fight going down to the wire.

And in third — with the exact haul of points required — Lando Norris held his nerve. That third place finish became monumental, as it secured him the 2025 World Drivers’ Championship by the slimmest of margins.

For Norris, the moment was more than just a podium: it marked his first-ever Drivers’ World Championship, underlining consistency, resilience and guts over the season.

Meanwhile, Verstappen’s win — perfectly executed — proved once again why he remains among the greatest on his day. But this time, even that wasn’t enough.  

Piastri ended the weekend with a strong second in the race and a solid overall season — though short of the title, his pace and composure earned respect.
